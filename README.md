 **DESCRIPTION OF TASK(In this task, I developed a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information. The website consists of multiple sections including a homepage with my introduction, an about section highlighting my background and technical skills, a projects section displaying my work with descriptions, and a contact section for users to reach me. I used HTML and CSS to design and structure the site, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive across different devices. The goal of this task was to demonstrate my ability to build and style a professional-looking website that represents me as a budding web developer.)
